# Jessica Sharp 

Jessica is a managing consultant with [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com) who stays involved in her local database user groups and helps organize Python and other programming events nationwide. For almost 10 years of her pre-open source life she was an independent Oracle consultant specializing in data migrations and the cloud. 

Eventually Postgres caught her attention and EDB beamed her up. She enjoys technical challenges and values bringing customer perspectives into practical and engineered solutions.
